            <p>
              Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized
              applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls
              digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible
              anywhere in the world.

              The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization

              of a large community of organizations, individuals, and companies
              that support the network, our mission is to do what only we can to
              help ensure success for Ethereum in the long-term. The
              Foundation's role is to allocate resources to critical projects,
              to be a valued voice within the Ethereum ecosystem, and to
              advocate for Ethereum to the outside world.

            <p>
              Ethereum is a decentralized system, which means it is not
              controlled by any single governing entity. Ethereum opens the door
              to a global financial system where an Internet connection is all
              you need to access applications, products and services that
              operate in a trustless manner. Anyone can interact with the
              Ethereum network and participate in this digital economy, without
              the need for third parties and without the risk of censorship.

            <p>
              While Ethereum can reindustrialize everything from voting to
              supply-chain tracing, not all applications will be compatible with
              a decentralized approach, and that’s okay.

            <p>
              Bitcoin is a blockchain technology that serves strictly as a
              currency. Ethereum is also a blockchain technology, but its code
              allows it to serve as an open-source platform and operating
              system, on top of which other applications can be built. These
              decentralized applications built on Ethereum have been coined
              "dApps".
